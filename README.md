# Mutual-Fund-Investment-Plan

Mutual funds are investment plans that pool money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other securities managed by professional fund managers. A mutual fund plan is created by selecting stocks from which an investor can benefit in the long term and analyzing the market performance over time.

The dataset for creating a mutual fund investment plan is created by analyzing past performance in the market. The dataset consists of daily closing stock prices of 50 major Indian companies from multiple sectors (banking, technology, consumer goods, and automotive). Each company is represented by a ticker symbol (e.g., RELIANCE.NS, ICICIBANK.NS), and the dataset includes the following features:
  - Date: The date on which the stock price is recorded.
  - Closing Price: The adjusted closing price for each stock on its particular date.
  - Companies: A total of 50 top Indian companies are represented, covering a range of sectors like Banking (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank), technology (TCS, Infosys), consumer goods (Hindustan Unilever, ITC), automotive (Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, and others.

Problem Statement:
Balancing between risks and returns is no easy task. Therefore, I developed a Mutual Investment Bucket (MIB) optimized for long-term investments by selecting companies that provide consistent growth and moderate returns while minimizing exposure to volatility. Hence, the objectives are:
1. Stock Selection: Identify stocks with high Return on Investment (ROI) and low volatility, which will form the core of the mutual fund's portfolio.
2. Performance Evaluation: Use metrics such as volatility (standard deviation) and expected ROI to assess which stocks are optimal for inclusion in the portfolio.
3. Investment Strategy: Simulate the expected future value of investments based on monthly contributions over different time horizons (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years).
4. Risk-Reward Balance: Develop a strategy that ensures a balance between risk and reward, targeting long-term investors who seek stable, compounded growth over several years.
